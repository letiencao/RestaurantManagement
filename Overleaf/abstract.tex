Today's businesses need efficient and effective methods of keeping track of daily transactions to help them with various tasks such as stock levels and cash flow. With competition stronger than ever business owners need reliable information to make well informed decisions that may effect their business in the short and long term. Storing and retrieving accurate and up-to-date information is crucial as is the ease in which it can be accessed and broken down into forms such as graphs and excel sheets where it can be easily read and analysed. This is where we saw the need to develop a Restaurant Management and Point-of-Sale (POS) system for a café or restaurant business environment. The main programming language for implementation is PHP coupled with javascript and a MYSQL database.\par
The system aims to make more efficient the workflow of a user by providing a fast and easy-to-use UI as well as very accurate, up-to-date and easily accessible reports for owners and management.\par
While this particular system has been designed for use in a restaurant or café it can be adopted, with ease, to be used anywhere a business needs the combination of easily accessible reports, stock management, customer integration and a working till system all in one.
